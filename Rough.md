## 🔐 Common Android Vulnerabilities (OWASP-Aligned)

Here’s a simplified guide to the most important types of security issues that can affect Android apps:

---

### 1. **Insecure Data Storage**

* Storing sensitive info (like passwords, tokens) in plain text on the device (e.g., SharedPreferences, internal storage).
* 🔓 Risk: If device is rooted or compromised, data can be easily accessed.
* ✅ Fix: Use encrypted storage or Android Keystore for sensitive data.

---

### 2. **Insecure Communication**

* Sending data over unencrypted channels (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS).
* 🔓 Risk: Attackers on the same network (Wi-Fi) can intercept data.
* ✅ Fix: Always use HTTPS + proper certificate pinning when needed.

---

### 3. **Insecure Authentication**

* Weak or broken login systems (e.g., predictable tokens, no session expiration).
* 🔓 Risk: Attackers may impersonate users.
* ✅ Fix: Enforce strong authentication with secure token storage and validation.

---

### 4. **Insufficient Cryptography**

* Using outdated or weak encryption (e.g., MD5, hardcoded keys).
* 🔓 Risk: Data can be decrypted by attackers.
* ✅ Fix: Use Android’s Keystore and modern cryptographic standards (e.g., AES with strong keys).

---

### 5. **Unintended Data Leakage**

* Sensitive data unintentionally exposed via logs, screenshots, clipboard, backups, etc.
* 🔓 Risk: Other apps or attackers may grab data.
* ✅ Fix: Don’t log sensitive info, use `FLAG_SECURE`, and disable backups for private data.

---

### 6. **Improper Platform Usage**

* Misusing Android APIs or failing to follow best practices (e.g., exposing components without permissions).
* 🔓 Risk: App components may be hijacked by malicious apps.
* ✅ Fix: Properly declare/export components, use permissions wisely.

---

### 7. **Code Tampering**

* APKs being modified or reverse-engineered by attackers.
* 🔓 Risk: Malware injection or stealing code.
* ✅ Fix: Use code obfuscation (e.g., ProGuard), tamper detection, and signature checks.

---

### 8. **Reverse Engineering**

* Attackers decompile the APK to view code, logic, or secrets.
* 🔓 Risk: Theft of intellectual property or security flaws.
* ✅ Fix: Obfuscate code and avoid hardcoded secrets in the APK.

---

### 9. **Insecure Component Usage**

* Using outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries.
* 🔓 Risk: Inherited security bugs.
* ✅ Fix: Regularly update dependencies and monitor them via tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check`.

---

### 10. **Improper Session Handling**

* Not invalidating sessions on logout or timeout.
* 🔓 Risk: Session hijacking.
* ✅ Fix: Invalidate tokens, use short-lived tokens with refresh flow.

---

## 🔍 Bonus: Android-Specific Issues to Be Aware Of

* **Component Hijacking** – Exposed Activities, Services, or Broadcast Receivers without proper protection.
* **WebView Exploits** – Loading untrusted URLs or enabling JavaScript without caution.
* **ADB Misuse** – Leaving debug features open in production apps.
